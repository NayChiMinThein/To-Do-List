In my pursuit of web development, I successfully crafted a to-do list website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, drawing inspiration from a helpful YouTube video. While I took the initiative to design the user interface, I admit that I have encountered some challenges, resulting in incomplete code that leaves me unsatisfied with the final result. As a novice in this field, I am eager to grow and refine my skills, seeking assistance and guidance from experienced developers or any generous individuals willing to lend their expertise. Your valuable feedback and support would greatly contribute to improving my project and bolstering my understanding of web development. Thank you for considering my request as I continue to learn and evolve on this rewarding coding journey.
